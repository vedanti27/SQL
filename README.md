## Practice Session 1

This session is an introduction to basic database operations using Python and SQL. Here's a brief overview:

1. **Connecting to Database**: connection, creating new dB and dropping it.
2. **Creating Tables**: creation insertion operations
3. **Retrieving Data**: retrieve data from a SQL database. 
                        This includes retrieving all data and retrieving specific data based on certain conditions.
4. **Selecting Specific Columns**: We learn how to select specific columns from a table in the database. 
5. **Identifying Unique Values**: We learn how to identify unique values in a column using the `DISTINCT` keyword.
6. **Updating Records**: We learn how to update records in the database.
7. **Deleting Records**: We learn how to delete records from the database. In this case, we delete the 'student' table from the database.

This session provides a practical understanding of basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in a SQL database using Python.
